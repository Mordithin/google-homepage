This was my first attempt at building anything with html/css. 

Goal: Make a webpage that looks like the default Google homepage.

Functionality: none, purely visual to keep things simple. 

Things I learned:
- Utilize developer tools to inspect elements of a webpage 
- Create a simple navbar with elements on both right and left side

What I should improve:
- Proper HMTL hierarchy, I feel like I was just using div for everything
- Simpler ways to move elements around, maybe use CSS Flex Box or Grid
 in the future
